# Project-Optimal-Portfolio-of-Securities
In this project, I found the optimal portfolio of securities using multiobjective optimization (maximize returns and minimize risk) and exterior penalty method in MATLAB. I assigned multiple weights to return and risk for 3 scenarios - 1. Equal weightage to return and risk, 2. Favoring risk, 3. Favoring return.
The data set that I used for this code contains 4 stocks with their expected annual returns over a period of 10 years.
